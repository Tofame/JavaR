# JavaR: Simple RPG Engine

JavaR is a free and open-source RPG engine written in Java (Anything from /res folder is NOT open source. Only the code is). This project is developed from scratch, following the tutorial series by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow/featured). 
It provides a foundation for creating your own RPG or you can further develop this one.

### Bin folder empty, missing .class files
In case the bin file is empty, so you can't run the project due to missing .class files you gotta open **cmd** 
then cd to the src folder and use the following comand: </br>
```for /r %x in (*.java) do javac -d . "%x"``` </br>
It will generate .class file for each .java file. Then you need to move them to the correct folders in bin.
